# NWNutrientComparatorVVVV
A vvvv path - with subpatches - comparing recommended vs. consumed nutrients using the Harris-Benedict-Formula.

## Instructions

In this version, it's rather simple to generate output. Simply enter the person's size, weight and age and the patch will calculate the rest on its own.

Then add what the person ate (proteins, carbs and fat) on one day and the patch will compare both data sets.

## Known issues

1. Can't differ between male or female
2. Can't overrule calculated value for proteins

## Changelog

1.0 - 13.6.2017 - initial release
